Abstract

   This document outlines a recommendation to the Internet operational
   community to reject RPKI Invalid BGP announcements on all EBGP
   sessions.  It includes guidance for both IP networks and Internet
   Exchange Points (IXPs).  The approach is to ensure the global
   Internet routing system's security posture is robust against
   misconfigurations and other BGP incidents.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI based BGP Origin Validation [RFC6811] has matured to the point
   of it being the best current practise for Internet operators to help
   mitigate the negative effects of misconfigurations and other BGP
   incidents in the global Internet routing system.  This document
   promotes the validation mechanism to a best current practise.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendation

   This document recommends that IP network operators and IXP operators
   SHOULD reject RPKI invalid routes on all EBGP sessions.  RPKI
   monitoring statistics that out of the 19% of Internet Prefix/ASN
   pairs that are signed and valid, 0.85% are invalid [RPKI-NIST].
   There is a legitimate concern about losing traffic from routes that
   are signed but invalid.  In practice, the impact has been shown to be
   minimum in the case of operators who have applied this policy
   [TELIA].
